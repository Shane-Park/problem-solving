# ğŸ’» Problem Solving

## Intro

This repository is history of my algorithm practice. ps is my favourite hobby so I always wanna do better, be exceptional.

I'm a kind of beginner yet but I really enjoy it and love to share idea with others who are also interested in.

most of code are written in Java. more Kotlin code will be added in the future.

**Any feeback will be always appreciated.**

I use those websites to solve problems, mostly leetcode which I never forgot the daily ones.
